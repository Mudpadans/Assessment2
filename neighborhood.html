        <p>Gainesville is a city in Georgia that is the main seat of Hall county, sometimes it's called a part of Atlanta but this isn't true. Because of the sheer amount of poultry plants in the area, it's nicknamed the poultry capital of the world.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Originally, it was founded as "Mule Camp Springs" in the early 1800s, then it was named 'Gainesville' after a War of 1812 general named Edmund P Gaines. The population and business grew exponentially 1830s after gold was discovered in nearby Lumpkin county, and it grew even faster after the civil war when it was a given a train station. After World War 2, the poultry industry of north Georgia was pioneered here by Jesse Jewell and since then, chickens are Georgia's largest agricultural crop. Nearby to the northwest is Lake Lanier, which was created by army engineers in 1956 through damming up the Chattahoochee river at Buford. This lake is allgedly haunted according to locals, this is because theres's a high rate of deaths at the lake due to boating accidents and underwater debris. During the 1994 Atlanta Olympics, Gainesville was used as venue for the rowing and kayaking competitions on Lake Lanier.</p>
